	<p>Angklungs are Southeast Asian idiophones formed from bamboo.  Each angklung consists of at least two bamboo tubes, but in half to varying lengths mounted on a bamboo frame.  One end is secure while the other is unfixed-when shaken, the tubes strike one another and produce sound.</p>
	<p>Each angklung has a unique pitch, requiring additional angklungs, and often people, to create a complete melody.  In group performances, each individual is responsible for their particular tone.</p>
